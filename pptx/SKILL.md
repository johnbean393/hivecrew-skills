# PPTX creation, editing, and analysis

## Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .pptx file. A .pptx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.

## Reading and analyzing content

### Text extraction
If you just need to read the text contents of a presentation, you should convert the document to markdown:

```bash
# Convert document to markdown
python3 -m markitdown path-to-file.pptx
```

### Raw XML access
You need raw XML access for: comments, speaker notes, slide layouts, animations, design elements, and complex formatting. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a presentation and read its raw XML contents.

#### Unpacking a file
`python3 ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_dir>`

**Note**: The unpack.py script is located at `skills/pptx/ooxml/scripts/unpack.py` relative to the project root. If the script doesn't exist at this path, use `find . -name "unpack.py"` to locate it.

#### Key file structures
* `ppt/presentation.xml` - Main presentation metadata and slide references
* `ppt/slides/slide{N}.xml` - Individual slide contents (slide1.xml, slide2.xml, etc.)
* `ppt/notesSlides/notesSlide{N}.xml` - Speaker notes for each slide
* `ppt/comments/modernComment_*.xml` - Comments for specific slides
* `ppt/slideLayouts/` - Layout templates for slides
* `ppt/slideMasters/` - Master slide templates
* `ppt/theme/` - Theme and styling information
* `ppt/media/` - Images and other media files

#### Typography and color extraction
**When given an example design to emulate**: Always analyze the presentation's typography and colors first using the methods below:
1. **Read theme file**: Check `ppt/theme/theme1.xml` for colors (`<a:clrScheme>`) and fonts (`<a:fontScheme>`)
2. **Sample slide content**: Examine `ppt/slides/slide1.xml` for actual font usage (`<a:rPr>`) and colors
3. **Search for patterns**: Use grep to find color (`<a:solidFill>`, `<a:srgbClr>`) and font references across all XML files

## Creating a new PowerPoint presentation

When creating a new presentation, use an **image-first workflow**. Each final slide should exist as a single full-slide image, and then those images should be assembled into a `.pptx` file.

### Required workflow

1. **Create a plan for each slide in Markdown files**
   * Create one Markdown file per slide (for example `slides/slide-01.md`, `slides/slide-02.md`, etc.)
   * Each file should include at minimum:
     - slide title
     - slide goal
     - audience takeaway
     - exact on-slide text
     - image / visual direction
     - layout notes
   * Also create an `outline.md` summarizing slide order and narrative flow.

2. **Create a full-slide image for each slide**
   * The image must contain the **entire slide composition**: background, text, charts, icons, photos, labels, and any other visual elements.
   * Do **not** build the slide from separate PowerPoint text boxes unless the user explicitly asks for editable slide objects.
   * Preferred output naming: `rendered-slides/slide-01.png`, `slide-02.png`, etc.

3. **If a PPT template is provided, you MUST use it**
   * This is mandatory.
   * Extract template text and visuals first:
     ```bash
     python3 -m markitdown template.pptx > template-content.md
     python3 scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx workspace/template-grid
     ```
   * Read `template-content.md` and inspect the generated grid image(s).
   * Create `template-inventory.md` describing which template slides are suitable for:
     - title / cover
     - section divider
     - text-heavy content
     - quote / callout
     - comparison / data storytelling
     - closing slide
   * Select only the template slides that fit the needed content. You do **not** need to use all template slides.
   * Convert the selected template slides into images, then use the **generate_image** tool to edit those template-derived images into the final slide images.
   * The edited image should preserve the template's design language while replacing placeholder content with the real slide content.

4. **If no template is provided, generate each slide image from scratch**
   * Use the slide Markdown plan as the source of truth.
   * Use the **generate_image** tool to create each finished slide image.
   * The generated image should already be presentation-ready and contain all slide content.

5. **Combine slide images directly into a PowerPoint presentation**
   * After all slide images are ready, place one image per slide into a new `.pptx`.
   * Use `scripts/images_to_pptx.py`:
     ```bash
     python3 scripts/images_to_pptx.py rendered-slides output.pptx
     ```
   * The script creates a presentation where each slide is a full-bleed image.

6. **Return all outputs in the outbox**
   * Final `.pptx`
   * All generated / edited slide images
   * All Markdown planning files
   * Any template analysis files created during the workflow

### Template-first guidance

When a template exists, follow this decision process:
1. Identify slide types available in the template.
2. Match each planned slide to the closest template layout.
3. Reuse only the layouts that genuinely fit the content.
4. Edit the chosen template slide images into final slides with `generate_image`.
5. Keep typography, spacing, color logic, and composition aligned with the template.

### Markdown planning format

Use a structure like this for each slide plan:

```markdown
# Slide 01 - [Title]

## Goal
[What this slide must accomplish]

## Audience takeaway
[What the viewer should remember]

## On-slide text
- [Exact heading]
- [Exact bullets / labels / captions]

## Visual direction
- [What imagery / chart / illustration should appear]
- [If using template: which template slide/image to adapt]

## Layout notes
- [Relative placement, emphasis, hierarchy, spacing]
```

### Creating slide images from a template

Recommended workflow:
1. Convert the template to a thumbnail grid for visual selection.
2. Convert the chosen template slide(s) to images:
   ```bash
   soffice --headless --convert-to pdf template.pptx
   pdftoppm -png -r 150 template.pdf workspace/template-slide
   ```
3. Pick the appropriate page image(s).
4. Use `generate_image` with the template slide image as the reference image.
5. Prompt the model to preserve layout/design language while replacing content.

### Creating slide images from scratch

If no template is supplied:
* Choose a design approach that matches the topic and audience.
* Keep all text readable at presentation size.
* Avoid dense paragraphs and tiny labels.
* Ensure each image is already suitable to drop directly into PowerPoint.

### Final validation

Before finishing:
1. Confirm slide count matches the Markdown plan.
2. Confirm every slide image is present and correctly ordered.
3. Build the `.pptx` from the final images.
4. Optionally create a thumbnail grid of the final presentation to sanity-check ordering:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/thumbnail.py output.pptx workspace/final-grid
   ```
5. Validate the final `.pptx` with `ooxml-validator` and treat any errors as blockers before returning the file:
   ```bash
   ooxml-validator output.pptx
   ```
6. Save the final `.pptx`, slide images, and Markdown files to `/Users/hivecrew/Desktop/outbox/`.

### Legacy HTML workflow

The `html2pptx` workflow remains available for specialized cases where editable PowerPoint objects are explicitly required, but it is **not the default workflow** for new presentation creation. The default is the image-first workflow above.


## Editing an existing PowerPoint presentation

When edit slides in an existing PowerPoint presentation, you need to work with the raw Office Open XML (OOXML) format. This involves unpacking the .pptx file, editing the XML content, and repacking it.

### Workflow
1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~500 lines) completely from start to finish.  **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.**  Read the full file content for detailed guidance on OOXML structure and editing workflows before any presentation editing.
2. Unpack the presentation: `python3 ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_dir>`
3. Edit the XML files (primarily `ppt/slides/slide{N}.xml` and related files)
4. **CRITICAL**: Validate immediately after each edit and fix any validation errors before proceeding: `python3 ooxml/scripts/validate.py <dir> --original <file>`
5. Pack the final presentation: `python3 ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file>`
6. Validate the repacked `.pptx` with `ooxml-validator` before returning it or ending the task: `ooxml-validator <office_file>`

## Creating a new PowerPoint presentation **using a template**

When you need to create a presentation that follows an existing template's design, you'll need to duplicate and re-arrange template slides before then replacing placeholder context.

### Workflow
1. **Extract template text AND create visual thumbnail grid**:
   * Extract text: `python3 -m markitdown template.pptx > template-content.md`
   * Read `template-content.md`: Read the entire file to understand the contents of the template presentation. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.**
   * Create thumbnail grids: `python scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx`
   * See [Creating Thumbnail Grids](#creating-thumbnail-grids) section for more details

2. **Analyze template and save inventory to a file**:
   * **Visual Analysis**: Review thumbnail grid(s) to understand slide layouts, design patterns, and visual structure
   * Create and save a template inventory file at `template-inventory.md` containing:
     ```markdown
     # Template Inventory Analysis
     **Total Slides: [count]**
     **IMPORTANT: Slides are 0-indexed (first slide = 0, last slide = count-1)**

     ## [Category Name]
     - Slide 0: [Layout code if available] - Description/purpose
     - Slide 1: [Layout code] - Description/purpose
     - Slide 2: [Layout code] - Description/purpose
     [... EVERY slide must be listed individually with its index ...]
     ```
   * **Using the thumbnail grid**: Reference the visual thumbnails to identify:
     - Layout patterns (title slides, content layouts, section dividers)
     - Image placeholder locations and counts
     - Design consistency across slide groups
     - Visual hierarchy and structure
   * This inventory file is REQUIRED for selecting appropriate templates in the next step

3. **Create presentation outline based on template inventory**:
   * Review available templates from step 2.
   * Choose an intro or title template for the first slide. This should be one of the first templates.
   * Choose safe, text-based layouts for the other slides.
   * **CRITICAL: Match layout structure to actual content**:
     - Single-column layouts: Use for unified narrative or single topic
     - Two-column layouts: Use ONLY when you have exactly 2 distinct items/concepts
     - Three-column layouts: Use ONLY when you have exactly 3 distinct items/concepts
     - Image + text layouts: Use ONLY when you have actual images to insert
     - Quote layouts: Use ONLY for actual quotes from people (with attribution), never for emphasis
     - Never use layouts with more placeholders than you have content
     - If you have 2 items, don't force them into a 3-column layout
     - If you have 4+ items, consider breaking into multiple slides or using a list format
   * Count your actual content pieces BEFORE selecting the layout
   * Verify each placeholder in the chosen layout will be filled with meaningful content
   * Select one option representing the **best** layout for each content section.
   * Save `outline.md` with content AND template mapping that leverages available designs
   * Example template mapping:
      ```
      # Template slides to use (0-based indexing)
      # WARNING: Verify indices are within range! Template with 73 slides has indices 0-72
      # Mapping: slide numbers from outline -> template slide indices
      template_mapping = [
          0,   # Use slide 0 (Title/Cover)
          34,  # Use slide 34 (B1: Title and body)
          34,  # Use slide 34 again (duplicate for second B1)
          50,  # Use slide 50 (E1: Quote)
          54,  # Use slide 54 (F2: Closing + Text)
      ]
      ```

4. **Duplicate, reorder, and delete slides using `rearrange.py`**:
   * Use the `scripts/rearrange.py` script to create a new presentation with slides in the desired order:
     ```bash
     python3 scripts/rearrange.py template.pptx working.pptx 0,34,34,50,52
     ```
   * The script handles duplicating repeated slides, deleting unused slides, and reordering automatically
   * Slide indices are 0-based (first slide is 0, second is 1, etc.)
   * The same slide index can appear multiple times to duplicate that slide

5. **Extract ALL text using the `inventory.py` script**:
   * **Run inventory extraction**:
     ```bash
     python3 scripts/inventory.py working.pptx text-inventory.json
     ```
   * **Read text-inventory.json**: Read the entire text-inventory.json file to understand all shapes and their properties. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.**

   * The inventory JSON structure:
      ```json
        {
          "slide-0": {
            "shape-0": {
              "placeholder_type": "TITLE",  // or null for non-placeholders
              "left": 1.5,                  // position in inches
              "top": 2.0,
              "width": 7.5,
              "height": 1.2,
              "paragraphs": [
                {
                  "text": "Paragraph text",
                  // Optional properties (only included when non-default):
                  "bullet": true,           // explicit bullet detected
                  "level": 0,               // only included when bullet is true
                  "alignment": "CENTER",    // CENTER, RIGHT (not LEFT)
                  "space_before": 10.0,     // space before paragraph in points
                  "space_after": 6.0,       // space after paragraph in points
                  "line_spacing": 22.4,     // line spacing in points
                  "font_name": "Arial",     // from first run
                  "font_size": 14.0,        // in points
                  "bold": true,
                  "italic": false,
                  "underline": false,
                  "color": "FF0000"         // RGB color
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      ```

   * Key features:
     - **Slides**: Named as "slide-0", "slide-1", etc.
     - **Shapes**: Ordered by visual position (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) as "shape-0", "shape-1", etc.
     - **Placeholder types**: TITLE, CENTER_TITLE, SUBTITLE, BODY, OBJECT, or null
     - **Default font size**: `default_font_size` in points extracted from layout placeholders (when available)
     - **Slide numbers are filtered**: Shapes with SLIDE_NUMBER placeholder type are automatically excluded from inventory
     - **Bullets**: When `bullet: true`, `level` is always included (even if 0)
     - **Spacing**: `space_before`, `space_after`, and `line_spacing` in points (only included when set)
     - **Colors**: `color` for RGB (e.g., "FF0000"), `theme_color` for theme colors (e.g., "DARK_1")
     - **Properties**: Only non-default values are included in the output

6. **Generate replacement text and save the data to a JSON file**
   Based on the text inventory from the previous step:
   - **CRITICAL**: First verify which shapes exist in the inventory - only reference shapes that are actually present
   - **VALIDATION**: The replace.py script will validate that all shapes in your replacement JSON exist in the inventory
     - If you reference a non-existent shape, you'll get an error showing available shapes
     - If you reference a non-existent slide, you'll get an error indicating the slide doesn't exist
     - All validation errors are shown at once before the script exits
   - **IMPORTANT**: The replace.py script uses inventory.py internally to identify ALL text shapes
   - **AUTOMATIC CLEARING**: ALL text shapes from the inventory will be cleared unless you provide "paragraphs" for them
   - Add a "paragraphs" field to shapes that need content (not "replacement_paragraphs")
   - Shapes without "paragraphs" in the replacement JSON will have their text cleared automatically
   - Paragraphs with bullets will be automatically left aligned. Don't set the `alignment` property on when `"bullet": true`
   - Generate appropriate replacement content for placeholder text
   - Use shape size to determine appropriate content length
   - **CRITICAL**: Include paragraph properties from the original inventory - don't just provide text
   - **IMPORTANT**: When bullet: true, do NOT include bullet symbols (•, -, *) in text - they're added automatically
   - **ESSENTIAL FORMATTING RULES**:
     - Headers/titles should typically have `"bold": true`
     - List items should have `"bullet": true, "level": 0` (level is required when bullet is true)
     - Preserve any alignment properties (e.g., `"alignment": "CENTER"` for centered text)
     - Include font properties when different from default (e.g., `"font_size": 14.0`, `"font_name": "Lora"`)
     - Colors: Use `"color": "FF0000"` for RGB or `"theme_color": "DARK_1"` for theme colors
     - The replacement script expects **properly formatted paragraphs**, not just text strings
     - **Overlapping shapes**: Prefer shapes with larger default_font_size or more appropriate placeholder_type
   - Save the updated inventory with replacements to `replacement-text.json`
   - **WARNING**: Different template layouts have different shape counts - always check the actual inventory before creating replacements

   Example paragraphs field showing proper formatting:
   ```json
   "paragraphs": [
     {
       "text": "New presentation title text",
       "alignment": "CENTER",
       "bold": true
     },
     {
       "text": "Section Header",
       "bold": true
     },
     {
       "text": "First bullet point without bullet symbol",
       "bullet": true,
       "level": 0
     },
     {
       "text": "Red colored text",
       "color": "FF0000"
     },
     {
       "text": "Theme colored text",
       "theme_color": "DARK_1"
     },
     {
       "text": "Regular paragraph text without special formatting"
     }
   ]
   ```

   **Shapes not listed in the replacement JSON are automatically cleared**:
   ```json
   {
     "slide-0": {
       "shape-0": {
         "paragraphs": [...] // This shape gets new text
       }
       // shape-1 and shape-2 from inventory will be cleared automatically
     }
   }
   ```

   **Common formatting patterns for presentations**:
   - Title slides: Bold text, sometimes centered
   - Section headers within slides: Bold text
   - Bullet lists: Each item needs `"bullet": true, "level": 0`
   - Body text: Usually no special properties needed
   - Quotes: May have special alignment or font properties

7. **Apply replacements using the `replace.py` script**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/replace.py working.pptx replacement-text.json output.pptx
   ```

   The script will:
   - First extract the inventory of ALL text shapes using functions from inventory.py
   - Validate that all shapes in the replacement JSON exist in the inventory
   - Clear text from ALL shapes identified in the inventory
   - Apply new text only to shapes with "paragraphs" defined in the replacement JSON
   - Preserve formatting by applying paragraph properties from the JSON
   - Handle bullets, alignment, font properties, and colors automatically
   - Save the updated presentation

   Example validation errors:
   ```
   ERROR: Invalid shapes in replacement JSON:
     - Shape 'shape-99' not found on 'slide-0'. Available shapes: shape-0, shape-1, shape-4
     - Slide 'slide-999' not found in inventory
   ```

   ```
   ERROR: Replacement text made overflow worse in these shapes:
     - slide-0/shape-2: overflow worsened by 1.25" (was 0.00", now 1.25")
   ```

## Creating Thumbnail Grids

To create visual thumbnail grids of PowerPoint slides for quick analysis and reference:

```bash
python3 scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx [output_prefix]
```

**Features**:
- Creates: `thumbnails.jpg` (or `thumbnails-1.jpg`, `thumbnails-2.jpg`, etc. for large decks)
- Default: 5 columns, max 30 slides per grid (5×6)
- Custom prefix: `python3 scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx my-grid`
  - Note: The output prefix should include the path if you want output in a specific directory (e.g., `workspace/my-grid`)
- Adjust columns: `--cols 4` (range: 3-6, affects slides per grid)
- Grid limits: 3 cols = 12 slides/grid, 4 cols = 20, 5 cols = 30, 6 cols = 42
- Slides are zero-indexed (Slide 0, Slide 1, etc.)

**Use cases**:
- Template analysis: Quickly understand slide layouts and design patterns
- Content review: Visual overview of entire presentation
- Navigation reference: Find specific slides by their visual appearance
- Quality check: Verify all slides are properly formatted

**Examples**:
```bash
# Basic usage
python3 scripts/thumbnail.py presentation.pptx

# Combine options: custom name, columns
python3 scripts/thumbnail.py template.pptx analysis --cols 4
```

## Converting Slides to Images

To visually analyze PowerPoint slides, convert them to images using a two-step process:

1. **Convert PPTX to PDF**:
   ```bash
   soffice --headless --convert-to pdf template.pptx
   ```

2. **Convert PDF pages to JPEG images**:
   ```bash
   pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 template.pdf slide
   ```
   This creates files like `slide-1.jpg`, `slide-2.jpg`, etc.

Options:
- `-r 150`: Sets resolution to 150 DPI (adjust for quality/size balance)
- `-jpeg`: Output JPEG format (use `-png` for PNG if preferred)
- `-f N`: First page to convert (e.g., `-f 2` starts from page 2)
- `-l N`: Last page to convert (e.g., `-l 5` stops at page 5)
- `slide`: Prefix for output files

Example for specific range:
```bash
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 -f 2 -l 5 template.pdf slide  # Converts only pages 2-5
```

## Code Style Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: When generating code for PPTX operations:
- Write concise code
- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations
- Avoid unnecessary print statements

## Dependencies

Required dependencies (should already be installed):

- **markitdown**: `pip install "markitdown[pptx]"` (for text extraction from presentations)
